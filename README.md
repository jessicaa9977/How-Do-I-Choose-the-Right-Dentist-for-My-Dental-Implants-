Dental Implants
Dental implants are often considered the best method of tooth replacement available. It is important to note, however, the final outcome of your dental implant surgery can be significantly impacted by the dentist you choose. Dr. Sadineni, a specially trained cosmetic dentist in Powell & Hilliard Ohio, recommends that dental implant candidates spend time carefully researching their options for providers.

Important factors to consider when making your decision about which dentist should perform your procedure include:

· Frequency with which the dentist performs dental implant surgery

· Credentials and history of their success

· Quality of the porcelain crown used to finish the dental implant

To help inform your choice, Dentist in Powell & Hilliard Ohio also recommends reviewing before-and-after photos of previous patients as well as reading patient testimonials. These resources can serve as a visual reference for possible results as well as give you a first-hand account of the experience.
